A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Introduction

React is a great tool for building frontends. It has a very diverse eco-system with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However it can be overwhelming to be forced to make so many choices.
It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like but that flexibility comes with a cost.

There is no pre-defined architecture developers can to follow which often leads to messy, uncosistent or over-complicated codebases.

This is an attempt to present the way of creating React applications using the best tools in the eco-system and a good project structure that scales very well.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a collection of good practices when developing React applications. It is supposed to showcase most of real-world problems of an application in a practical way.

Feel free to explore the codebase to get most of it.
